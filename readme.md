# Sphinx Says
A simple simon says game I made in 36 hours. The code is optimized for
the time constraint I had so its a bit messy, sorry.

It uses a FASTLED library and 6 8LED neopixel strips with 6 buttons
The game also sends midi notes out in

This project is part Game, part Art, and part Controller. A re-envisioning of a Simon Says game with a cute 3d Printed Sphinx Cat Enclosure. The physical Component sends MIDI music notes from an Egyptian Scale to the pc to be interpreted as notes being played or controller input. I am working on adding a multiplayer mode with 2 Sphinxes and Also using the Sphinx to control a Unity game for an added experience. 

The game was made for a PIGsquad summer slow jam with the themes being Gadgets and Unconventional pets. I envisioned a Sphinx Cat Showing the player a melody and the player having to play it back correctly or loose. The Electronic components used are composed of a Teensy 3.2 and a NeoPixel Led Strip cut into six 8pixel strips and push buttons. On the computer side reason is generating and modulating the synth sounds.

There is lots of room for growth and I would like to hear your ideas.

I really enjoyed showing this game to people and seeing a smile on their faces. It was a lot of fun Big thanks to Control H and Portland Indie Game Squad.
